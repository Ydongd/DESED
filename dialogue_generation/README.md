## Dialogue Generation

[DialoGPT](https://github.com/microsoft/DialoGPT) for English and [CDial-GPT](https://github.com/thu-coai/CDial-GPT) for Chinese are used for dialogue generation. 

For DialoGPT, dialogues can be directly generated with the interface provided by huggingface.

For CDial-GPT, we use the code in their repo to conduct training and generating.
