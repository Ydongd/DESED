## Datasets

Two datasets are used: ACE2005 and FOSAED.

ACE2005 can be obtained in https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2006T06 (not free). We follow [ONEIE](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/software/oneie/) to split and preprocess.

We curate and propose a new Chinese event detection dataset named FOSAED, which is collected in the domain of food safety based on a leading e-commerce platform for food service.
