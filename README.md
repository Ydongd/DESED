# Dialogue-based Explanation for Sentence-level Event Detection (DESED)

The repository contains codes and datasets for Paper "DESED: Dialogue-based Explanation for Sentence-level Event Detection"

## Introduction

This repo includes codes for DESED. For dialogue generation, we use [DialoGPT](https://github.com/microsoft/DialoGPT) for English and [CDial-GPT](https://github.com/thu-coai/CDial-GPT) for Chinese. For event detection, we offer three attention mechanisms. All models we use are from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/models).

We curate and propose a new dataset named FOSAED, a real-world Chinese event detection dataset in the domain of food safety.

More details can be seen in our paper.
